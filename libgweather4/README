libgweather is a library to access weather information from online 
services for numerous locations.

libgweather4 is the latest version of libgweather. libgweather4 can be
installed together with libgweather also avaiable in SBo.

Below variables can be used to configure the build
  GTKDOC=yes         : Whether to generate the API reference
                       Requires gi-docgen and enabling INTROSPECTION
  INTROSPECTION=no   : Whether to generate introspection data
  VALA=no            : Don't install vala bindings
                       VALA requires enabling INTROSPECTION
  TESTS=yes          : Whether to build the tests and tools
  OWNAPIKEY=APIKEY   : Specify an API key for OpenWeatherMap

note: if webkit2gtk4.1 is present, this lib will use soup3 instead
of soup2, so it will need an extra dependency of libsoup3.
